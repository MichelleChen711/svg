# SVG
Drawing on the Web: Version Control Assignment

I wanted to utilize svg animation with something clean and simple but also interesting. In order to make use of shape manipulating attributes with a duration, I decided on the idea of unravelling one-by-one images of a cat running across the page. I made the middle cat stand out to subtly indicate that it has a link attached.
